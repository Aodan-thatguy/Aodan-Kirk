### Card Games
> Over the past 2 years I have developed and tested 2 card games. These games have only been played by me and a select group of friends. They are not anywhere close to offically published games. However, I be very much open to any kind of publishing of these games.
>
> These card games are Monsters and Mercinaries and Goon War.
#### M&M (Monsters & Mercinaries)
> A simple two player deck building game. Inspired by games like Inscryption. The game plays around with cost mechanics and uses different abilities to make different card of kinds.

#### Goon War
> A card game I made for my friends and me based off inside jokes about each of us. Each one of my friends has a speific deck which a bunch of inside joke cards surrounding them. The gamplay and menchanics proved to be very fun when used right. Its an elimination based game where each has to defend their base while at the same time trying to destroy the other players bases.

### The IDKWCT Show
> The IDKWCT is an animated Webshow I've been working on for the past 3 years. I haven't uploaded an episode in over a year now. However, the show is still very much in develpoment. I'm currently saving all the episodes after they are finished to upload them all relatively close to each other. The show has expanded in the years of development to encompass a variety of themes. There is a even a video game adaptation in the works as I write this.

### Future Projects
> There are sevral more projects I am working on as now for to not be completed far in the future. These projects are still very far from even really starting any offical development. I will not mention anything about them here as to not say anything that will possiblely be defuct in the future. However, I can certainly say these projects are certainly very important and it is my passion to get them produced.
